🧠 Project Overview
The goal of this research was to [briefly explain goal, e.g., develop a system for detecting cardiac abnormalities using ECG signals].
Key highlights:
Utilized Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
Applied [e.g., Wavelet Transforms, K-Means Clustering] to extract features and classify ECG data.
Designed for integration into portable, real-time monitoring devices.
